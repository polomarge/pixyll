On our inner speech and narration:
“We are all fragmented,” Fernyhough writes. “There is no unitary self. We are all in pieces, struggling to create the illusion of a coherent ‘me’ from moment to moment.”
	- consider how narration works in books and how the character is shaped by the author's narration and even adverbs he uses -- thinking of our lives as a story is probably cliche but there's some parallel there that we're witness to all the time, we can think of the adverbs as our outlook, and they're shaped by so many things
    - how we think of other's narration and inner speech
    - children


Fernyhough: When we use descriptive experience sampling [in which people are asked to report on their own inner speech] , we assume that a lot of what people say when they are asked about their experience is kind of generalizations about what they think is in their own minds rather than what is actually in their own minds. And that's why people can be surprised by DES. People can think their thoughts are a bit negative but they turn out to be quite joyful, or vice versa. And that is a really fascinating philosophical question, because it suggests we can be mistaken about our own experience. And if we can be wrong about what goes on in our heads, then that's pretty wild.

On being content:
I used to roll my eyes in boredom but I have slowly become one of those Yoga People. (I blame the stereotypical grey of Seattle and the way the instructors at my studio somehow know every dang pressure point in my neck and act as human versions of those whisk-looking head scratches that I want but feel so ridiculous owning. I had a roommate who used her cat for this purpose and I feel a strong retroactive envy)
Each class, the instructor gives a two-minute speil with some sort of theme of the day, sometimes producing vague platitudes but sometimes provoking a sense of calm in my swirly head. Lately my thoughts converge on the idea of contentness and the fine, fine lines between settling and growing and accepting and breathing.

On the whole, I am in a terribly privileged position right now. I don't know if it's society conditioning me to want more or my own restlessness or perfectionism or boredom and when I talk to my boyfriend he brings up my Type-A personality and then I get defensive, and now I'm thinking more about the whole inner speech idea, that we're not even good judges of what's going on in our minds. I've never been able to be totally comfortable with therapy -- my restless and sad thoughts stick out the most, but on the whole I'm a pretty content person. 
I get lonely, but I love my friends. I get anxiety and I feel guilty for the anxiety, which only exasperates it, and I get sick of the feeling when it creeps up when I'm with my boyfriend and I feel self-centered the whole way. Then I go volunteer and go to work and solve problems and answer questions and I feel okay again. I drink too much coffee and not enough.

I think this is being human. I hope.

I feel an itch to move somewhere else and start an entirely new career and then I pass by the glittery rainbow sidewalks and my view at work lets me see Rainier peeking out over the Sound sometimes, and sometimes we see the sunset from there and all stare at how dang beautiful the world is.

I want to write more, with more structure, to join more conversations, and then feel entirely narcisstic for the urge. 

"california was calling but nobody was hiring, didn't want to be in Ohio, got a job in steel mill in Montana, friend was in Santa Monica so on weekends I went and hung out on the beach (laughs)




items to consider:
	- social media influence?
    - general post-college life
    - incredible privilege and guilt for feeling this way
    - general struggle with humanity
    - inner speech 

Children's book: what the heck are those floating words in your mind?
	- story of children born, brain starts growing
	- soon they can speak out loud, but also realize they can speak to themselves!
	- are these thoughts important? yes
	- they contain all your hopes and dreams and imagination!
	- and they go a lot faster than your speaking
	- will this freak out children
	- it would freak me out


The phrases "politically correct" and "fiscally conservative" confuse me
