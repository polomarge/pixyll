On not knowing and curiosity:
	- That venn diagram of what you know vs. don't know
    - How it relates to religion and morality and secularism
    - How scared we are to say "I don't know" when everyone in the world is adding their opinion to everything -- which I think is incredibly liberating and wonderful, but also adds pressure and makes me scared to make any claims, especially original ones
